                  <p>
                    I was thrown ten feet across the road in a severe car accident. When I regained
                    consciousness, the world looked the same. But nothing in my body felt like my
                    own anymore.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The doctors were kind and also honest. "Manage your expectations," they said.
                    Not out of denial, but out of a deep knowledge that the body holds more
                    intelligence than any prognosis can measure.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I turned to what modern medicine could not offer me; ancient breathwork,
                    conscious movement, sound therapy. Practices that do not just treat the body,
                    but awaken it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Slowly, then completely, I returned to myself. No physical limitations. No
                    mental ones either. Not because I was exceptional. Because the body was always
                    capable of this. It had simply been waiting to be remembered.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If you are feeling lost right now, exhausted by pain, burnout, fear, or a life
                    that no longer feels like yours, I want you to know something: that aliveness
                    you are reaching for is not gone.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Today I work with professionals and individuals who are done shrinking, who are
                    ready to stop managing their limitations and start dismantling them.

                  confidence to make decisive action."
